# Superstore Profit & Discount Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes profit data from the Superstore dataset to understand
why some orders result in losses.

## Problem Statement
Although the business is profitable overall, some products incur losses
at certain discount levels. The goal is to identify these products and
their discount thresholds.

## Tools Used
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Dashboard, Slicers)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)

## Key Insights
- Losses are mainly caused by high discounts, not regions.
- Tables cause losses even at small discounts (20%).
- Machines start causing losses at around 40% discount.
- Binders cause heavy losses at very high discounts (70–80%).

## Business Recommendations
- Avoid discounting Tables.
- Limit Machine discounts to 30%.
- Avoid extreme discounts on Binders.
